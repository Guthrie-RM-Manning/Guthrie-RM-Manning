- 👋 Hi, I’m @Guthrie-RM-Manning
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Networking, System Administration, and Foreign Policy!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Foundational skills for Cybersecurity such as PowerShell, XML, PHP, Python, and how to use a variety of tools and techniques focused primarily on Cyberecurity but seeking to build out solid understanding of Networking.
    - Currently Studying for CCNA, HTB's CDSA (Although might just finish the coursework and pivot over to CPTS as that seems to carry more weight), and taking some community college classes on Linux Administration, Network Resource Administration, and coding! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scripting, cybersecurity concepts, and network concepts
- 📫 How to reach me email: guthrie.manning727@gmail.com or LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/guthrie-rm-manning/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am ridicuously knowledgeable of all-things coffee - spent years in the specialty coffee industry and have tried most coffee varietials on the market and beans from most countries which grow coffee.
